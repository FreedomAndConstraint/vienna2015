			<p>It seems that our time brings the overwhelming feeing that "oh, the world is not stable any more". </p>
			<p>This is because we are used to see our systems in terms of well defined stable states and transitions between these states, which represent change. Now, when the change becomes so fast that we struggle to grasp any 'stable' states and get overwhelmed by the complexity.</p>
            <p>We hardly grasp change itself only as what transforms one stable situation with another</p>

                <p>We used to think of society in terms of the picture on the right; but it seems to be more like the picture on the left;</p>

            <p>Both hierarchy and chaotic behaviour are "partial representations" of the the social system and therefore partially true:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We see hierarchies in society emerging: (1) Because they are really there; (2) Because we are 'wired' to see stable patterns;</li>
                    <li>But also we see the flowing dynamics:(1) When the change is slow, we see one state/thing 'transforming' to another; (2) But when it is fast, we lose the reference point - everything becomes fluid;</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Therefore it may be better to describe the society not in terms of outermost states of the fluid-hierarchical dichotomy, but as 'viscous'; The degree of 'viscosity' here represents the speed of change; So we can say that society becomes more "viscous".</p>

            <p>The coupling of structure and dynamics of a metastable system (Living Cognitive Society is such a system) happens via the mechanism of progressive determination</p>

            <p>Therefore, progressive determination:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Describes how every next structure depends on the operation and every next operation depends on the structure;</li>
